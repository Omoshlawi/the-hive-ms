# Properties service

** Difference between property and listing **

- The `Property` model describes the asset itself (e.g., an apartment, house, office space).
- The `Listing` model describes how the property is being made available (e.g., for sale, rent, lease, auction, etc.).


  ðŸ’¡ Think of it this way:
  A single property (e.g., a 4-bedroom house) can have multiple listings over timeâ€”it might be for sale today and for rent later if it doesnâ€™t sell.
