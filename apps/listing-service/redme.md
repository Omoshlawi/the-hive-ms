## Usage Notes

1. Each listing type extends the core listing model
2. All monetary values are stored in smallest currency unit
3. Dates are stored in ISO 8601 format
4. JSON fields allow for flexible additional data storage
5. Soft deletion is implemented via the `voided` field

## Database Considerations

1. Indexes are recommended on:

   - `propertyId`
   - `organizationId`
   - `status`
   - `type`
   - `price` (for range queries)
   - `listedDate`

2. Foreign key constraints:
   - Each listing type references the main listing via `listingId`
   - Cascade deletion is enabled

## Best Practices

1. Always validate currency codes against ISO 4217
2. Implement proper decimal handling for monetary values
3. Use timezone-aware datetime handling
4. Validate JSON fields against predefined schemas
5. Implement proper security deposit handling

## Auction

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Starting Bid (startingBid)

- The starting bid is the lowest possible bid a buyer can place.
- It‚Äôs usually set lower than the actual market value to attract more bidders.
- The higher the demand, the more bids a property will receive.

- üí° Example:
  A 3-bedroom house in Nairobi has a market value of KES 10M, but the auction starting bid is set at KES 6M to encourage interest.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Reserve Price (reservePrice)

- The reserve price is the minimum amount the seller is willing to accept.
- If the highest bid is lower than the reserve price, the property won‚Äôt be sold.
- If there‚Äôs no reserve price, the highest bid automatically wins.
- üí° Example:
  - If the starting bid is KES 6M, but the reserve price is KES 8M,
  - then: If the highest bid is KES 7.5M, the property is not sold.
  - If a bidder places KES 8M or more, the property is sold to them.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Bid Increment (bidIncrement)

- The bid increment is the minimum amount a new bid must exceed the previous bid.
- It prevents small, insignificant increases (e.g., KES 1).
- It can be fixed (KES 100,000) or percentage-based (e.g., 5% of current bid).
- üí° Example:
  If the current bid is KES 6.5M, and the bid increment is KES 100,000, the next bid must be at least KES 6.6M.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Auction Start Date (auctionStart)

- Specifies when the auction officially begins.
- Bidders cannot place bids before this date.
- üí° Example:
  A property auction starts on August 10, 2025, at 10:00 AM.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Auction End Date (auctionEnd)

- The deadline for bidding.
- After this time, no new bids are accepted.
- üí° Example:
  The auction ends on August 17, 2025, at 5:00 PM.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Pre-Registration Required (preRegistration)

- If true, bidders must register before placing bids.
- This helps prevent spam and fraud by verifying participants.
- üí° Example:
  If preRegistration = true, bidders must submit identity documents (e.g., National ID, KRA PIN, or proof of funds) before the auction.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Bidder Approval Required (bidderApproval)

- If true, bidders must be approved before participating.
- Used for high-value properties or exclusive auctions.
- üí° Example:
  A KES 50M luxury home auction requires bidder approval to ensure serious buyers only.
